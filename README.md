Made by - Om Gupta

## Task
We are predicting the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

## Model Used
We have used Random Forest Regressor and Extra Trees Regressor for solving this problem.

## Results
The RMSE value of the model with Random Forest is 46.26 and with Extra Trees Regressor is 41.786 .
